You'd be telling her to socialise with the other dogs as she looks at you with her tongue out, panting and running towards the ball. Maybe we'd drop her back home and go to a quieter place for dinner, and I'd listen to you yap as your food turns cold (maybe finish it for you too hehe)."

But if that doesn't happen, then we both would just try to figure a way out of the elevator. If it's really all day, then maybe you'd have to kill me since you'll eventually need to pee and I can't be there when that happens."
